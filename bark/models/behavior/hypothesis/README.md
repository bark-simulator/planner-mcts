# Behavior Hypothesis Implementation

One can define hypothesis over behavior models and track posterior beliefs over behavior hypothesis based on the implementation given in this module.
For further information on the ideas behind the concepts of behavior spaces and behavior hypothesis design over behavior spaces, please have a look into the corresponding [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11281).
